# IBM-Cognos-Dashboards
Practicing and creating IBM Cognos dashboards on various datasets to explore insights and trends. This repository reflects my journey in building a strong data analytics and visualization portfolio.
The dashboards analyze NYPD Motor Vehicle Collision Data, focusing on injury and fatality trends among vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.

The goal of this project was to practice building meaningful visualizations, apply analytical thinking, and demonstrate my ability to work with BI tools like IBM Cognos.

 📊 **Dashboard**
 
**1. Pedestrians & Cyclists – Injury & Fatality Trends**
This dashboard highlights the injury and fatality patterns specifically for pedestrians and cyclists.
Key insights include:

 * Total number of injured pedestrians and cyclists.

 * Fatality counts broken down by pedestrians and cyclists.

 * Year-over-year trends with an interactive timeline filter.

**2. Vulnerable Road Users – Injury & Fatality Trends**
This dashboard provides a broader view of all vulnerable road users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.
Key insights include:

 * Total injuries and fatalities across all categories.

 * Separate breakdowns for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.

 * Interactive timeline to track yearly changes in injuries and fatalities.


**⚙️ Tools & Skills Applied**
